  <h2>Welcome</h2>

    <p><b>2017-06-23:</b> Welcome to my site. I quickly redesign the website to look more modern and simple that has mobile-first design approach. Since this website was founded back when I was in middle school, not much has changed since I have been very inactive over these past 6-8 years (Man I feel old). This website is just mainly a webpage that contains old Gameboy Color Games tips.</p>

    <blockquote>Welcome to my site. It has been a while since I have done a major update to my site. The site layout has changed signficantly now supporting mobile devices, firefox, ie10 (hovereffect problem), and safari. I have quit studying web designing since entering highschool, so this probably the last major change I'll have in the site.</blockquote>
<p><b>2017-06-23:</b> That surely was not the case. The previous website was not a mobile website but just reffited. Thus today's website layout release is a mobile-first design concept using Bootstrap. (I know I have said I would not make any major changes in the website). As an update, I have actually studied a bit on web programming in Highschool by focusing on the serverside programming such as PHP and databases. In addition, I have played around with FreeBootCamp recently, a free open source community that has lots of great coding challenges to help people learn webdesign. I recommend people to try it out.</p>  
<blockquote><p><b>2013-10-29:</b> I decided to play around with PHP and the site is expected to be updated significantly as I study more about PHP and programming. I thinking of re-learning web designing and go further into programming and web designing until I graduate from High School</p></blockquote>
<p><b>2017-06-23:</b>As I said earlier, I did study programming further in Highschool for fun. However, I was hoping to not study programming after high school but that never happened. Unfortunately (or fortunately), I am in university studying Computer Science at some Canadian University even though I never applied for the program. I will be further studying databases in the Fall and Web Computing in the Winter since they are offered in my university. However, I probably will not aim for a Computer Science job even though I am studying Computer Science because I have not much interest in Computer Science other than Operating Systems and Security. </p>
